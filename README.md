# JWriter

## About
JWriter a word processor with note taking and goal setting ablities. It is
foused for authors to write fiction and non-fiction alike.  Notes can be put
into to the file anywhere yet allow easy to navigate to them. The goal settings
can be adjest as the document written.

Even though the markup language is made for this program, is very forgiving and
will highlight the syntax. In the future, there will be more support and will
have a [WYSIWYG mode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG). This make learning
the language as just a faster way to format and insert notes and agendas.

This project is currently in alpha version, and will be optimized and will have
more features.
