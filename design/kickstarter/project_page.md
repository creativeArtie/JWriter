# What is Writer Studio

Writer Studio is my personal open-source project designed with writer needs
in mind. An market word processor comes with too much unused features that
people don't use or gives their computer virus. Writer Studio tries to be
a new distaction free writing software that will focus more than creative 
writing and allow you do all things needed for writing project.

# Who am I?

(a paragraph explainning how the project be could be a underdog story)

1. is a underdog story
    - struggle with language
        - not fit into a ESL program (that I think it suppose to fit everyone)
        - actually, I was told it fit everyone at info session
    - struggle with social life, get isolated from grade 6, not much friends before
    - on mental disablity check and never have an taxable income

(a paragraph of why I doing this project, and how it ends up on KickStarter.)

1. doing project like this keeps me from suicide
2. wants a creative writing software that is free to use, distraction free and
    comes with good writing features
3. natually the idea develops beyond creative writing to become useful to
    even more people
4. nows lives in a quiet corner on GitHub, but unlike me, the project seemed to
    want go out in the world
