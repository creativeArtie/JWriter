Kickstarter fund goal: $11,000 CAD

# What is Writer Studio

Writer Studio is my personal open-source project designed with writer needs in
mind. An market word processor comes with too much unused features that people
don't use or gives their computer virus. Writer Studio tries to be a new
distaction free writing software that will focus more than creative writing and
allows you do all things needed for writing project.

# Who am I?

This kickstarter project is an underdog story. (People love to support a underdog,
right?) First, I struggle with English. One time I was not able to "fit in" into
a ESL program, despite the presentaters at info session said full confidence
that they will fit me somewhere in their program. I also on disablity checks
because of my depression. I don't even have a very friends and family support
for this project.

# Project History

I like to doing personal project like Writer Studio keep me mentally stable and
also wanting a creative writing software that is free to use, distraction free
and with a bunch of good writing features. I natually developed the idea beyond
to just creative writing to become useful to more people. It currently recieve
active development from me in a quiet corner on GitHub, although I feel like it
needed to be shared and gain continual support.

# Features

Writer Studio is a software that do everything you'd need from brainstorming
to final draft while removing feature that you don't use. I would like the
program to have modes that following the recommanded writing guideline of
brainstorming, outlining, writing, and editing. Writer Studio will export PDF
file following industry standard formats with a single button click.

On IT best practice side, Writer Studio will organize your mulit-file writing
project (ie. manuscripts for a series of novels) in to a single folder without
you needing to know how to organized a folder.

Writer Studio will also has things find in a creative writing software: goal
setter, distraction free screen, note taker, etc.

In the current version 0.3.3.2, you can already:

- create to do list;
- sort and add notes;
- export the document into a industry standard manuscript format (mostly);
- use the distraction free screen;
- navigates the document in different ways; and
- write and save a document

Writer Studio still needs an interface that does not depend on learning a
custom markup language, a project management system, edit mode, research mode,
spell check and many other feature I would like to add.

# Why I Need Your Help

I would like to make an income from the project, and launch it on Android. A lot
of writers (including me) get distracted if they work at home and a tablet is
easier to carry. Writer Studio is written in Java anyways, so porting to Android
shouldn't be that hard.

# Strech Goal 1

If this Kickstarter campiagn hits $132,000, I will start professional printing
system to go along with Writer Studio. Writer Studio will print the document on
a 32 lb. letter or legal size paper. Depend on your choice, the document will
then inserted into a prepaid envlope and then either (1) send to you so you can
check the quality and put into mail box yourself or (2) send directly to place
with the return address as your home address.

This will look impress with your letter, but also with envlope which complete
with print addresses and postal indicia.
