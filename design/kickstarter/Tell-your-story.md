    - a novel and letters to publishers/agents
    - a fantasy series with bible
    - job search with targeting cover letters and resumes
    - personal letters sent by slow but homely snail mail
2. do the above with professional printing and sending with a single click of a button

## Beyond Kickstarter

1. launch the project into Android
2. free to use with paid plugins that you didn't know you'd want (I hope)
3. cloud backup and maybe sent to home CD backup
4. (even more ideas!)
