#Who are you?
- grew up and lives in Vancouver, BC
- recovering mental health illnesses, creates projects to maintain my mental health
- has a computer science diploma
- worked on smaller project, upload on GitHub, GitLab
- honestly, the project is bigger then my confidence can handle

#What are you planning to make?

## For Kickstarter (printer idea):

1. an all inclusive writing program that can handle project, like
    - a novel and letters to publishers/agents
    - a fantasy series with bible
    - job search with targeting cover letters and resumes
    - personal letters sent by slow but homely snail mail
2. do the above with professional printing and sending with a single click of a button
3. an all inclusive app on Android with plugins

## Beyond Kickstarter

2. paid plugins for more complex things (ie. advance citation system, story anaylsising)
3. sending scented romantic letters
4. (even more ideas!)

## Will continue to make even if the kickstarter project success or fails

1. Modes separating between writing, and editing.
2. Version control and document management, allowing note sharing with all files
   in a single project.
3. A standard graphical user interface mode along with the program's customized
   markup language
4. Formatting template for different type of documents

# Where did this project come from?

- From the need of making a word processor for my own writing
- From wanting to develop something I could make all by myself that I can share
  and be useful to others
- letting the project take shape and discovering it's purpose:
    - a writing program that allow you make a writing project from the
      beginning to the the end
    - free to use base program, paid addons for specific domains
- became one of my many projects that I wished to see success out in the wild
- the project idea started 5-6 years ago, with some phototype.
- the current version started last year when I needed some project for mental
  wellness

# What’s your plan, and what’s your schedule?

- making formatting template and printing system by the October; this would
  fulfil the main goal of this Kickstarter advanture
- implements the folder management and grahic user interface by Decemeber; this
  would let people to use the program as they would use Word
